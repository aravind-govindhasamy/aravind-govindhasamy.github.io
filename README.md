# Aravind Govindhasamy — Portfolio (2026)

Personal portfolio of **Aravind Govindhasamy** — Full Stack Developer (IoT platforms, FastAPI backends, AI-powered computer vision).

Built with Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/).

## Editing content

All site content lives in a single config file: [`src/data/resume.tsx`](./src/data/resume.tsx) — profile, socials, work, education, skills, projects, hackathons, and certifications. Blog posts are MDX files in [`content/`](./content/) (frontmatter requires `title`, `publishedAt`, `summary`). Case studies are MDX files in [`content/case-studies/`](./content/case-studies/) (schema in [`content-collections.ts`](./content-collections.ts)); the three with the lowest `order` also show on the home page.

## Getting started locally

pnpm install
pnpm dev
