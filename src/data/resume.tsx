    "Senior Full Stack & IoT Platform Developer with 4+ years of hands-on production experience - FastAPI & React platforms, MQTT telemetry, RFID & ILMS enterprise systems (SOUL, KOHA, AutoLib, ERPNext), hardware serial drivers, and AI automation built and operated in production.",
  summary:
    "I'm a full-stack developer and platform engineer with over 4 years of hands-on production experience shipping web platforms, backend microservices, and IoT systems that talk directly to hardware. Right now I'm at [Semicon Media](https://www.circuitdigest.cloud/), architecting the Circuit Digest Cloud IoT platform end to end: FastAPI services over MQTT, React dashboards, GeoLinker GPS fleet tracking with polygon geofencing, Razorpay + Airtel M2M SIM lifecycle automation, WebRTC video, and computer vision APIs on DigitalOcean. Before that, I built campus enterprise systems at PSGR Krishnammal College (RFID smart gate turnstiles serving 5,000+ daily users, GLPI asset tracking across 1,800+ physical endpoints, and an OJS publishing platform) and spent 2.5 years at 2CQR Automation engineering mission-critical RFID library and retail ERP software—connecting hardware readers to INFLIBNET SOUL, KOHA, and AutoLib, developing iSmartShelf and return dropboxes with Razorpay fine payments, and diagnosing 150+ production protocol and hardware issues. I like owning a problem end to end: database schema to device firmware to responsive UI. More: [education](/#education), [certifications](/#certifications), or [download my resume](/resume.pdf).",
